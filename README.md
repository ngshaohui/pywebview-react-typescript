# React + TypeScript + Vite + Pywebview

Marginally improved typing for using React + Typescript with Pywebview

## Installation

TODO

## Building

Has been tested to be able to build with nuitka

```bash
uv run nuitka --standalone src/index.py
```

Not yet able to use `--onefile` flag as it will raise an exception `Exception: No index.html found`
